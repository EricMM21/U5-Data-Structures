# Unit 5 - Data Structures

## [L2 Sandbox][sandbox]

## Processing Arrays

Arrays are mainly used for creating large data-sets and completing some calculations on the data set.

Example: 

This [**website**](http://www.weather.gov/ind/Precip_scorecard_IND) shows the monthly precipitation for Indianapolis for the past 20 years. There is ALOT of data available. 

Let's create a program which will calculate the annual rainfall in January over the last 20 years. 

TO THE [**SANDBOX**][sandbox]

## Exercises

1. Find the annual average rainfall over the last 20 years. 

2. Prompt the user to enter the number of employees, then prompt the user for the hours each employee worked. Assuming each gets paid $12.25/hour, output each employee's gross pay.
